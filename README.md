Helping with the journey of life by providing an integrated aid for capturing
ideas, refining them and supporting acting on them.

Yes this is a broad remit, and there are many other websites, tools, and apps
that cover the same area. However this is my problem, I've got todo apps,
calender apps, mindmap apps, notes on loose paper, notes on various notepads,
... you get the idea. Masa aims to be a unifying system that is simple and lose
enough to capture all these thoughtsi in the same basic data format, while being
extensible enough to expand to replace all these individual tools or integrate
with them as needed.

## Where are we

Well at the moment this is an early stage project, so don't expect any stability
or utility. I'll update this readme with more information as the project
progresses.

## ADRs

The plan is to document the design as we "Go" with [ADRs](doc/adr/toc.md).
